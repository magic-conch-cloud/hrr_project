what is hrr? hrr is high school recycle robot 

made by grok -> everything in that link -> (https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_5fe3e2f0-9829-4711-bd19-e8ffca285bb5)
I made this for a school project. These files are used for domestic purposes and are actually meaningless.

i made virtual environment named myenv(no reason) if you don't want to do then just do
pip install -r requirements.txt for making same environment setting
if you know well then just see what is in there and choose what you need
any question -> ask to me or ask to ai -> me or ai will answer
